Day 40 – New Year, Old Worries

# 2024-12-31

**9:00 AM:**  
Had an interview with a startup in Miami, and I picture a life where we move there, *habibti*. It’s wild how every decision I make loops back to you.

**2:15 PM:**  
You say you’re staying home for New Year’s, and that makes me happy. I set my resolutions, and guess what? You’re my biggest motivation. Our picture is now my phone background—keeps me going.

**11:00 PM:**  
But something weighs on me. You respond less, and it feels forced. I’m with family, trying to stay positive, but *princess*, it’s hard when my heart is uneasy.

**11:59 PM:**  
I stay up just to text you at midnight, but you’re sleeping. You say you slept 13 hours because you’re sick, and it feels off. I just wanted to share this moment, you know?
