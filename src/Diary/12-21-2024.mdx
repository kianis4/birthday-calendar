Day 30 – Another Grind, Another Step
---

# 2024-12-21

**9:00 AM:**  
I wake up with you on my mind—like always. It’s routine now, *habibti*. Today feels like another grind day, but I’m motivated because I’m working toward something bigger for us.

**12:30 PM:**  
Midday, and you’re still all I think about. I picture the life we’re building—the one where you don’t have a single worry. You say you don’t need much, but *princess*, I want to give you everything. Every line of code, every solution I find—it’s for you.

**3:00 PM:**  
I’m at PGCL, grinding for hours. The place is empty, which I like, but you’re in the back of my mind. Even when I’m focused, you’re there, *my love*. Some days it feels overwhelming how much I care, but I don’t want to change that feeling for anything.

**5:00 PM:**  
You’re out with your family, and I’m still here, pushing forward. It’s funny how, even apart, I feel connected to you. I wonder if you realize how much of my day revolves around your happiness, your future.

**7:00 PM:**  
The sun sets, and I’m still grinding. One day at a time, *my everything*. One step closer to the life I envision with you. I see us looking back on these grind days and laughing at how I overworked myself just to make sure we had it all.

**9:00 PM:**  
I’m winding down, but you’re still front and center in my head. Thinking of you warms me, even in this cold, empty space.

**11:00 PM:**  
I finally pack up and reflect on the day. No matter how far I go or how much I do, it always circles back to you, Mariam. You’re my anchor, and the love I have for you is indescribable. Maybe one day, when you read these pages, you’ll see it in every word.

I love you. I’m never stopping, no matter how tough it gets. Because you’re worth it—always, *princess*.
