Day 44 – The Word 'Spark'

# 2025-01-04

**12:12 AM:**  
You just left, *hayati*. The air is heavy with everything we said. Tonight, we didn’t just speak—we unraveled. When you said you lost the spark, it felt like my world cracked. I kept it together, but inside, I was losing it. That word—spark—keeps echoing. How did I let us lose our light? But I realize sparks can fade, and fires can be rebuilt. I’m determined to rebuild ours, Mariam.

I know I hurt you with my trust issues, my scars. Hearing how it made you feel smothered tore me apart. You’re the last person I want to hurt, yet I did. But I’m a fighter, *my love*, and fighting for us means battling my own demons, too.

Tonight, I pray, forehead on the ground, tears streaming. I beg Allah for strength, for guidance, to be the man you deserve. I love you enough to let you go if that’s what you need, but you said you still want to try—that’s all I need to keep going, *princess*.

Writing these entries started as a way to process my feelings, but it’s become so much more. It shows me I love you unconditionally, and I’ll never stop. You are my reason, my purpose. My everything.

We built this love on a foundation strong enough to survive. Yeah, you said you lost the spark, and I said I felt nothing—but you and I both know that’s a lie. I feel everything for you, Mariam. Always. We started this with “Fuck around and find out,” and you found out exactly how deep I’ll go for you. For us. Forever.

**1:20 AM:**  
I’m still wide awake, remembering how we cried in each other’s arms. In those tears, I found hope. This won’t be easy, but nothing worth having is. I love you, *habibti*, and I promise I’ll fight for you until my last breath. No matter what.
