Day 11 – Aches and Apologies
---

# 2024-12-02

**10:12 AM:**  
I wake up restless. You’ve been swirling in my head all night, **hayati**, and I can’t shake this ache for you. I text you, trying to ground myself, but you call me crazy for wanting you so bad. Even your teasing makes my world brighter. Then you tell me to “make it go away before you leave the house,” and I’m here smirking, wondering how you always know the perfect thing to keep me on my toes.

**11:26 AM:**  
I’m getting ready, and I keep catching myself lost in thoughts of you. It’s wild how much space you take up in my head, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. I spray on Invictus—your favorite—and imagine you here, telling me I smell good, maybe giving me those gentle scratches on my arm that drive me crazy.  
I try to shake it off, focus on the day, but I can’t. You’re always there, **princess**, pulling me closer.

**2:17 PM:**  
I don’t know what I was thinking earlier on FaceTime with Sammy. I call our relationship weird, and I see the hurt in your eyes. It hits me hard. You always say I’m your safe space, your protector, and here I am, making you feel small in front of someone else. I’m better than that—*you* deserve better than that.  
Words aren’t enough to fix it. I want you to feel my apology, to know I mean it deep down.

---

**4:43 PM:**  
I send you a picture of my hair—this one random white strand. I’m hoping it makes you laugh. I’m so off when you’re upset, **meri jaan**, and I’d do anything to see you smile right now. Seeing that tear slip down your face? It breaks me.  
You tell me not to stress, that you’re just frustrated, but I can’t help it. When you’re not okay, nothing else is, either.

**6:28 PM:**  
I’m driving to Mississauga, the road humming under my tires, and all I can think about is the look on your face when I hurt you. I promised I’d never be the reason you cry, but I messed up. The weight of it is in my chest, but it’s not about me—it’s about you, about us.  
I’m trying to figure out how to fix this, how to show you just how much I love you.

---

**8:04 PM:**  
I’m finally home, but I can’t settle. You’ve been quiet, and it’s killing me. I texted you again, letting you know I’m thinking of you.  
If I don’t fix this today, then when you read this on your birthday, I hope you see how much I care. I know we’ll be okay, because I love you with everything I have.

---

**10:19 PM:**  
I’m lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to plan out how to make tomorrow better for you. I’ve always been the grinder, but for you, I want to slow down, show you you’re my priority.  
Today wasn’t perfect, but you’re still **my everything**, **habibti**—the reason I push so hard, day in and day out. Tomorrow, I’ll prove it again.

—**Love, Suley**
