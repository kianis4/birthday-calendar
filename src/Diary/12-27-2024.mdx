# 2024-12-27

**10:20 AM:**  
Been busy, not much talking today, but you’re still on my mind, *my love*. I miss you, but I keep grinding, reminding myself it’s for you.

**3:30 PM:**  
Pizza and steaks with Ibrahim, meeting new people. Good connections for the future, but I’m picturing how different it’d be if you were here, *hayati*.

**11:15 PM:**  
Focused on personal goals, too. The hustle never stops. I know we’ve got dreams, and I’ll keep pushing for them—for us.
