Day 26 – Early Mornings & Quiet Alarms
---

# 2024-12-17

**5:41 AM:**  
I wake up knowing you’re starting work early, *habibti*, and my first thought is hoping you’re okay. You’re always my priority, my peace. Even when life feels shaky, I want to make sure you’re safe.

**9:00 AM:**  
This feeling in my chest doesn’t leave—like a quiet alarm telling me something’s off. I can’t pinpoint it, and you say we’re fine. I’m trying not to let it break me. I promised to love you no matter what, and I stand by that, *my everything*.

**11:00 AM:**  
I’m grinding for my Amazon OA, but my mind loops back to you, *princess*. It’s exhausting, but also the fuel driving me forward. Everything I do is for us, even if you never asked. I want to give you everything anyway.

**1:30 PM:**  
Focusing is rough. I want success so badly, for both of us. But that uneasy shadow is still there. Am I overthinking? Possibly. Doesn’t change the fact I’m going all in for you, *my love*.

**6:00 PM:**  
Even deep in my work, I’m wondering if you’re smiling, if you’re thinking of me, too. I replay our recent conversations, trying to convince myself it’s all in my head.

**8:00 PM:**  
You say you’ll see me tomorrow, and for the first time in days, I feel a glimmer of relief. Just the thought of being near you eases my tension, but part of me is bracing, reading between the lines to make sure we truly are okay.

**11:00 PM:**  
Mariam, the feeling hasn’t left, but neither has my determination. I make dua for clarity, for our love to stay strong. I hold your words close, refusing to give up. Tomorrow, I plan to push aside this nagging fear and show you how much you mean to me. Because no matter how off things feel, I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere. You’re my reason, *hayati*.
