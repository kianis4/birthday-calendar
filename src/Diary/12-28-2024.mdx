Day 37 – Amazon Rejection & Promises
---

# 2024-12-28

**8:40 AM:**  
I wake up heavy, *habibti*. Something’s off, and I miss you more than I can say. Being away is harder than I thought, but I hold on to the idea that seeing you again will be worth it.

**12:15 PM:**  
I find out I got rejected from Amazon’s OA. It hurts, but the first thing I think is you—I don’t want to bring you down. I’ll tell you in person. I know you’ll say it’s okay, that I should keep going. I’m sorry if I let you down, *princess*, but I promise I’ll bounce back.

**9:30 PM:**  
I reflect all day, reminding myself that every setback is a setup for something better. I’m doing this for us, Mariam. I’ll keep getting better, no matter how tough it gets.
