Day 15 – One Step Closer

# 2024-12-06

**7:20 AM:**  
Good morning, **meri jaan**. You text me asking why I hung up last night, but I swear I didn’t. I love how even these tiny misunderstandings bring us closer. I’m looking at flights to Dubai today, thinking about building that life in the Middle East we always dreamed of. The idea of raising a family there with you makes my heart swell ❤️.

**1:08 PM:**  
I’m running around after Jummah, sorting out work. Your reminders about my interviews keep me on track. You always have my back, **princess**, and I hope you know how much that means to me.

**3:33 PM:**  
I pick up my paycheck, and it reminds me why I grind so hard: us. Every dollar, every hour—it’s all for the life I’m building for you. A life where you never worry, where you always feel safe and loved, **habibti**.

**11:18 PM:**  
It’s late, and I’m finally home. I shoot you a goodnight text, guessing you might already be asleep. I miss you, **my love**. Every day brings me one step closer to the life I want with you. I hope you dream of us tonight.

—**Love, Suleyman**
