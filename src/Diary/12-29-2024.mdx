# 2024-12-29

**12:03 PM:**  
First thought on waking up? You, *my love*. Always. It’s like you’re permanently etched into my mind, and I’m good with that.

**3:30 PM:**  
Spent the afternoon doing wedding choreo with Ibrahim. You know me—I’m no dancer, but for our wedding, I’ll give it my all. I promise, *hayati*.

**9:50 PM:**  
Ibrahim’s place is unreal, and it fuels my dreams for us. One day, babe, you’ll have everything you’ve ever wanted. That’s my goal.
