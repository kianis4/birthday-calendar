Day 5 – The Tension That Pulls Us Closer

# 2024-11-26

**7:21 AM:**  
You just hit me with the “morning babe” text, and it feels like you’re already setting the tone for my day. I’m in a weird headspace from yesterday, but seeing you pop up on my screen pulls me right out of it. You tell me your dad is calling you downstairs, so you get up early, but all I can think about is how I want you to stay in bed longer—preferably with me.

As I get ready, I keep imagining how soft your voice sounds when you’re here with me. You’ve got this way of saying my name that makes the world slow down for a second. If you’re by my side this morning, I know for a fact you’re not climbing out of bed so soon—I wouldn’t let you.

**11:20 AM:**  
We’re messaging back and forth, and I tell you to “come here” because, honestly, I can’t help myself. Just picturing you walking in, giving me that look you always give me—yeah, my mind is already racing. You don’t realize how much you affect me, do you?

There’s this heat between us that never cools. If you actually walk in right now, I’m not letting you leave without feeling exactly what you do to me.

**2:46 PM:**  
You just tell me you’re in class, and I can’t help but smirk. You’re so focused, so determined, and it’s one of the things I admire most about you. But in the back of my mind, I’m itching to interrupt that focus. If I could, I’d slide into that classroom, pull you out, and keep you all to myself for a while.

**7:00 PM:**  
You’re still in class, and I’m just counting down the hours until we can talk properly. Even on days like this—long and busy—you keep me grounded, Mariam. I’m replaying our messages in my head, and it makes the wait easier.

**11:38 PM:**  
You just let me know you forgot to call earlier, and your dad was waiting for you at home. You ask me to spare you from “punishment,” and I have to laugh. You know how to play innocent, but I see right through you.  
I tell you to give yourself a little smack for me—exactly how I would. You call me a freak, and maybe I am, but we both know you love it. You push my buttons, I push yours, and that’s what makes this so intense.  

**At the end of the night:**  
Today isn’t crazy—just another grind day—but you’re still at the center of it all. Even when we’re apart, you have this way of making me feel like you’re right here with me. I love how soft you are, but I also love how you let me pull you out of your comfort zone, just enough to remind you that you’re mine.

You balance me out, Mariam, and I’ll never stop wanting you—your warmth, your fire, your everything.  
 
—**Daddy** 😉
