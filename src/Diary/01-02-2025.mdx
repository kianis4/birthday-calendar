Day 42 – Sick Days & Weighted Hearts
---

# 2025-01-02

**8:00 AM:**  
We talk last night, and you say we’re fine. I want to believe it, *my love*, but this weight in my chest won’t go away. All I want is for you to feel better. I know you’re sick, and I pray Allah heals you soon so we can talk—*really* talk.

**12:15 PM:**  
I’m glued to my phone, rereading old messages, flipping through our pictures. It pulls at my heart, *hayati*, not knowing why it feels off. You’re my peace, but I feel like I’m losing you.

**3:30 PM:**  
I keep telling myself this is temporary, that we’ll push through. But it’s so hard, babe. I love you too much to ignore my gut.

**7:00 PM:**  
I make dua for your health, your happiness, and for us. You’re my light, Mariam, and I can’t stand seeing you like this. Even when it’s heavy, you’re my reason to keep going.

**11:00 PM:**  
The day ends, but my mind races. I want us back to normal. You don’t know how much I cherish you, how much you push me to be better. I love you, *habibti*, always.
