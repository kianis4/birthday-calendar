Day 9 – The Calm I Never Knew
---

# 2024-11-30

**9:15 AM:**  
Morning, *Habibti*. I just wake up, and you’re already on the move—running errands, handling life like you always do. You mention your dad being at the airport, and I know you’re gonna miss him. But if I’m being honest, I’m also thinking about how I get you to myself a bit more now. Yeah, it’s selfish, but that’s just how you’ve got me.  
I picture you heading to the dentist, probably scrolling on your phone, lost in your own thoughts. If I’m there, I’m holding your hand the whole way—just to remind you I’m here, always.

**12:20 PM:**  
You’re back home, cooking, and I can’t help but smile at the mental image. *Hayati*, you have this effortless way of doing everything, and I wish I’m right there, stealing bites and teasing you. You’d probably roll your eyes, tell me to quit bothering you, but I know you’d secretly love it.  
I sleep in a little today, and now I’m feeling like I need to catch up. Meanwhile, you’re out here making even the simplest parts of your day sound special.

**3:00 PM:**  
I’m at the mall, wandering around with no real direction, but my thoughts keep drifting to you, *my princess*. It’s quiet here, and I imagine us walking side by side, your arm looped through mine, pointing at random stuff in the stores that only you’d notice. You’d make me laugh with how adorable you get when you’re excited.  
I stop for some New York Fries, but it doesn’t taste the same without you. You make everything better, *my love*, just by being there.

**5:30 PM:**  
You tell me you threw up, and I feel that pang in my gut. You say you’re fine—just your body being off—but I know how you downplay things. I want to be there, taking care of you, making sure you’re comfortable. I’d have soup on standby, hold you tight until you drift off.  
But since I can’t, I send you whatever reassurance I can over text. You’re *my everything*, and knowing you’re not at 100% bothers me more than I want to admit.

**8:00 PM:**  
I just wrap up a basketball run, feeling good physically, but my mind’s on you, *gorgeous*. You’re resting in bed, and I’m picturing how peaceful you must look. I want to be next to you, running my fingers through your hair, helping you relax.

**11:43 PM:**  
Now I’m at the sauna, letting the heat wash away the day. But let’s be real—I’m still thinking about you. There’s this quote I catch earlier: “I didn’t fall in love with you because I was alone… I fell in love with you because you showed me something new.” That sums it up, *my life*. You’re not just someone I need—you’re someone I choose. You bring a calm to my chaos, a love I never saw coming, and now that I have it, I can’t imagine life without it.

**At the end of the night:**  
I can’t be there for you in person today, but I hope you feel how much I care. I want to be the one you lean on—whether you’re up or down, whether it’s a lazy day or absolute chaos. You push me to be better, *beautiful*, for both of us.  
When I see you next, I’m holding you a little tighter, kissing you a little slower, making sure you feel every bit of what you mean to me.
