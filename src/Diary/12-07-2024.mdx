Day 16 – Our Lighthearted Love
---

# 2024-12-07

**9:07 AM:**  
Good morning, baby. You didn’t hang up last night, but we’re still joking about it. These little moments show me how fun our love is—you always make me laugh, **hayati**.

**12:17 PM:**  
I get a haircut, but my laptop isn’t working, and it’s driving me nuts. I hate slowing down, but I know you’d tell me to breathe, to relax. You’re my calm in every storm, **my love**.

---

**2:01 PM:**  
You’re cleaning with your mom, and I miss your call. Even something so small sends a pang through me. My laptop’s still glitching, but I push on because I know you believe in me, **princess**.

---

**4:43 PM:**  
I try to fix the issue, no luck. Frustration’s piling up, but I think of you, telling me to take a break. You’re the only thing keeping me sane, **meri jaan**.

---

**9:26 PM:**  
Still grinding. My laptop acts up again, so I send you a pic, hoping you’ll laugh. You remind me it’s just a hiccup, that I’ll get through it. You’re my anchor, my **everything**, and the reason I keep pushing, even on the hardest days.  
Goodnight, **gorgeous**. I’ll tackle tomorrow because I know you’re with me.
