Day 2 – Lost and Found

# 2024-11-23

**2:56 AM:**  
I’m speeding back to Mac, my fists are about to rip off the wheel, cursing under my breath. I can’t find your card, Mariam, and it’s got me feeling like I fail you. I tell you I’ll keep it safe—tucked with my degree where I can always see it—so I remind myself how much you mean to me. And now? It’s gone. The thought of losing something so personal, so tied to you—it messes with my head 😓.  
You’re on the phone, calm as ever, telling me it’s no big deal, saying you’d write me another one. But nah, Mariam, that card is yours—your words, your heart on paper—and nothing else can replace it. I pray hard that when I get to the car, it’s right there.

**11:43 AM:**  
Hamdellah. The card is found, and guess what? It’s in the car the whole damn time, tucked under the seat like it’s hiding from me 🙄. I feel so stupid when my dad hands it over—I tear myself up all night, and it turns out I just don’t look hard enough. Classic me, huh? Overthinking, stressing, and then my dad comes through like a champ.

I hold the card for a minute, letting the relief wash over me. Your words hit me as hard as the first time I read them. It’s not just a card, Mariam—it’s a piece of you, and losing it, even for a few hours, reminds me how much I value everything you give me.

Those words I never forget:

> “**To Suley,**  
> My heart. My mind. My soul.  
> I am writing this letter to congratulate you on your graduation, but I also want this to be a reminder for you, so you can read this today, tomorrow, in a year, or when you’re 60.  
> Suley, you are the embodiment of intelligence. You are the embodiment of strength and perseverance. You are the embodiment of everything I want to be, and everything I want our children to be. This degree is a representation of your hard work, and this letter my appreciation of you. Keep both together.  
> **I LOVE YOU** ❤️  
> **-Mariam**”

**2:00 PM:**  
I’m taking a shower, and surprise, surprise—you’re the only thing on my mind 😏. The music is playing, but I barely hear it because my head is too full of you. I lean back against the wall, steam filling the room, and all I can think about is you being right here with me. If you’re here, I don’t let you go—not for a second. You’re pinned right there, my hands on your hips, the rest of the world forgotten. You’ve got that effect on me, gorgeous.

**4:35 PM:**  
I sit down to eat, but my mind wanders back to you—where we are now and where we’re heading. I tell you we need to break out, and I mean it. I’m gonna work harder, grind smarter, because I want to give you the life you deserve. I see us on an island, just you and me, with nothing but the sound of the ocean. That’s the dream, and I’m locked in.  
You tell me we already have good lives, and you’re right—we’re blessed. But for me, good isn’t enough—not for you. I want you to have everything. I want you to wake up every day with zero worries, knowing I’ve got it handled.

**6:15 PM:**  
You say you’re imagining yourself here, giving me scratches, and I can’t help but smile. It’s like you know exactly what I need, even from miles away. I picture it so clearly—your nails softly running down my back while you curl up against me 🫠. You’ve got this way of making me feel like everything’s right in the world when you’re close.

**8:13 PM:**  
I’m home now, exhausted, but I can’t sit still. Your voice is echoing in my mind, telling me to hit the gym, get my body and mind right. That’s what you do, Mariam—you push me to be better, even when you don’t realize it. You’ve got this fire in you that lights a fire in me.  
Before you go to sleep, you tell me not to forget you, and I almost laugh at how impossible that is. Forget you? You’re the reason I breathe. You’re in every corner of my mind, every beat of my heart.

Now it’s the end of the night, and I’m here reflecting on everything…  
Today reminds me how easy it is for me to get caught up, how losing the card for even a little while feels like losing a part of myself. But it’s not just about the card—it’s about what it represents: your love, your care, the way you pour yourself into everything for me.

You’re my anchor and my motivation, my peace and my fire. I have a lot to figure out, a lot to work on, but if there’s one thing I know for sure, it’s that I’ll do anything for you.

I’m yours, Mariam. Always. 😘

—**Your man**
