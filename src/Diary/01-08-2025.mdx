Day 48 - Grand Finale – A Birthday to Remember
---

# 2025-01-08

Hey, **princess** ❤️,  
Your **grandpa boyfriend** here—listen up for a second. Remember how this all started, when I dared you to “**fuck around and find out**” 😏? Well, guess what? **You did**, and you **keep** finding out, day after day, diary entry after diary entry. I’ve practically written an entire library of love notes, and believe me, I’ve never spent this much time on anything in my entire life. That’s how much space you take up in my head—spoiler: it’s **all the time**.

We’ve been through it, **habibti**. Every hiccup, every late-night breakdown, every time we almost lost it all—those moments made us stronger. I never just wanted to *tell* you how I feel; I needed to *show* you, in every word and every gesture. I’m not trying to be your dad, Mariam; I don’t have to be. I’m here to give you **my** kind of love—this relentless, move-mountains, “I got you, babe” type of love that only **I** can give.

And now, it’s your birthday. Somehow, I’m supposed to top over a hundred pages of diaries that basically scream, “She’s on my mind 24/7” 🤯. But hey, you finally see what I’ve been talking about—this insane, over-the-top gesture from a big, crazy heart. Whether you read every single word or not, know that each entry is soaked in emotion, each one reminding you, *Mariam, you are my world*.

You’re the reason I grind so hard, the reason I roll out of bed with a grin on my face every morning. You are the reason I **protect**, **spoil**, and **love** with everything I have. If you ever doubt how cherished you are, you know where to look: a whole **epic saga** of diaries proving nobody will ever fight for you the way I do.

Thank you for inspiring me, for being the breath in my lungs, for pushing me beyond limits I never thought I had. I promise to protect you forever—don’t you *dare* forget that. Even if I’m “older,” you can roll your eyes at my “grandpa” jokes, but just remember I’m the guy who fell head over heels for a girl who decided to “**fuck around**” and ended up finding out she holds my entire heart.

**Happy Birthday, Mariam** ✨  
Here’s to countless more days, weeks, months, and decades of you finding out just how deep this love goes. Trust me, **we’re only getting started**.

**All my love forever,**  
—Your (slightly older) Man
