Day 6 – The Anchor That Grounds Me
---

# 2024-11-27

**7:30 AM:**  
I’m awake, and you’re already on my screen, calling me a hooligan. The audacity—yet it makes me smirk because you know exactly how to get under my skin, and I let you. Don’t worry, I’ll fire back soon enough, but deep down, I’m glad to start my day with you. You have this way of making me feel lighter, even on mornings when I’ve got a million things on my plate.  
You’re heading out early with your dad to run errands, and all I can think about is how much I’d rather have you here instead. I’d keep you tangled up in my arms for a few more stolen minutes before the world comes knocking.

**11:00 AM:**  
You’ve been running around, handling groceries with your dad, and I’m dropping my mom off for her haircut. I’m sitting in the car, scrolling aimlessly, but my thoughts keep coming back to you. It’s like you’ve got this hold on me—one I can’t shake.  
I just text you something playful, maybe even a little slick, because I know you love it. I know you’ll pretend to roll your eyes, but I also know you’re smiling. Probably biting your lip a little, too, because you know I’m right. I can almost see the way your eyes light up when I tease you.  

**2:50 PM:**  
I’m grinding now, locked into work and applications. I’m at Thode with my head down, but you’re still there in the back of my mind. I just sent you my graduation photos, and your response made me grin. You say it’s cute and you love it, and hearing that from you hits differently.  
There’s something about the way you see me that pushes me to be better. You make me want to be the best version of myself—not just for me, but for you, Mariam.

**9:00 PM:**  
I’m heading to the gym now, getting ready to put in work, while you’re winding down from your day. I can tell you’re tired, but you still make time for me—like you always do.  

**At the end of the night:**  
Today is one of those non-stop days, but you’re still at the center of it. You’re my constant, my anchor. Even when we’re apart, you’re right here, reminding me why I go so hard.  
You’ve got this power over me, Mariam—more than just physical. You make me feel things I’ve never felt, and I can’t get enough of it. When we finally see each other again, I’m pulling you close, kissing you like it’s the only thing that matters, showing you exactly how much I want you.

—**Your man**
