Day 39 – Wedding Chaos & Missing You
---

# 2024-12-30

**11:00 AM:**  
It’s the big day—wedding function. I’m running around with family, but you’re on my mind, *princess*. Every break I take, I’m thinking about how I wish you were here.

**8:45 PM:**  
Even in all this celebration, I’m missing you. I can’t wait to tell you everything when we’re finally face to face again.
