Day 18 – Mirror Selfies & Midnight Grinds
---

# 2024-12-09

**10:59 AM:**  
I sent you a mirror pic, and you instantly spark that playful side of me. “This whole time showering??” you tease, and I’m laughing, *habibti*. The way you say, “You look good, babe,” hits me right in the chest. I’m grinning like a fool because feeling seen by you, *my love*, is everything.

**11:24 AM:**  
Even as I’m rushing to get ready, your words keep replaying in my head: “You look good, babe.” You’re so casual about it, but it means the world. Every little compliment from you feels like gold, and I’m carrying that sparkle with me all day.

**1:07 PM:**  
The grind doesn’t stop. I tell you, “Babe, I’m waiting for tests from 2:30 to 4,” and I’m already feeling the pressure. You always remind me to breathe, *princess*, but it’s tough with so much on my plate. Still, your voice in my head grounds me, reminding me to focus.

**2:39 PM:**  
This test feels endless, and I’m thinking about you. I know you’d tell me, “One step at a time, babe.” It’s like you’re right here, keeping me steady even in the chaos.

**3:08 PM:**  
Babe, I fixed my laptop! I texted you, i'm practically bouncing off the walls. *Alhamdulillah!* You’re my biggest cheerleader, *hayati*, and every small win feels bigger when I share it with you.

**3:55 PM:**  
You ask how I did it, and I smiled. "Hamdellah, babe,” you say, so supportive. I’m diving back into this test, knowing you’re proud of me. That’s the boost I need.

**6:52 PM:**  
Finally done with the test. “Done, babe,” I text. It goes okay, but frustration lingers from all the delays. Then there’s you, telling me to be patient, and I try, *meri jaan*, I really do.

**8:08 PM:**  
You always bring out my better side. “Babe, you gotta be patient,” you say, and it’s like you know exactly how to calm the storm in me. I end up showing grace where I might’ve shown anger, just by thinking of what *you* would do.

**8:30 PM:**  
You ask what I’m doing, and I say, “I’m just happy my laptop’s working.” But it’s more than that. It’s about having the tools to build a life for us, *my everything*. Every project, every late night—it’s for the future I see with you.

**8:35 PM:**  
You tell me to say “Bismillah” before pushing the project. That simple reminder means so much. You keep me grounded in faith and in life, *princess*.

**9:31 PM:**  
You’re heading to bed while I’m off to the gym. You say, “Keep me updated,” and I smile. You’re my safe space, my reason to keep going. Even when I’m tired, just knowing you’re there fuels me.

**1:26 AM:**  
It’s late, but I’m thinking about you. “Babe, check this out,” I text, excited to share my progress. Your opinion matters the most, *gorgeous*. I hope you feel the effort I pour into everything—for us.

**2:35 AM:**  
Home at last. I’m exhausted, but I help Sara with her essay, reminding myself that showing up for the people I love is important. And you, *hayati*, are the one I’ll always show up for, no questions asked.

Thinking of you today keeps me grounded. You’re my calm in chaos, my light in the dark. Goodnight, *my love*. I adore you more than anything. ❤️
