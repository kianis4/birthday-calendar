Day 31 – A Lighter Day

# 2024-12-22

**8:00 AM:**  
I wake up feeling lighter than I have in a while, *princess*. Hearing you say “I love you” first? It does something to me—like I’m truly yours in a way words can’t capture. I still can’t believe how much you center me, *habibti*. After the heaviness we’ve been through, I’m waking up today with a sense of calm, and it’s all because of you.

**11:00 AM:**  
I catch myself thinking about Bizu, that fluffy ball of attitude you keep telling me about. I laugh at the idea that when we finally meet, Bizu will probably love me more than she loves you. The thought of more little cats running around our future home makes me feel giddy. It’s these small glimpses of our “someday” that keep me pushing, *my love*.

**12:30 PM:**  
I’m still grinding, but my mind drifts to you every few minutes. I wonder if you feel the same sense of relief I do—that we’re okay, that we’re moving forward. It’s a reminder that real love takes patience, *hayati*. I’m waiting for you to tell me if something’s on your mind, but until then, I’m locked in on us—what we’re building, how far we’ve come.

**3:00 PM:**  
Afternoon hits, and I knock out for a nap without meaning to. Next thing I know, I’m waking up at 9:30 PM, phone on airplane mode. When I turn it on, your phone is off. *Instant panic*. My head spins, thinking the worst—because you know I overthink, *my everything*. But I try to breathe, telling myself you’d reach out if something was really wrong.

**9:30 PM:**  
Not being able to reach you is like having the air sucked out of the room. That panic sets in, reminding me how deeply I care for you. I hate feeling helpless, but I cling to the faith that you’ll text me the second you can. It’s a glaring reminder of how much my world revolves around you, *habibti*.

**11:00 PM:**  
You finally text me, and just like that, everything steadies. Your phone died—no big deal. But it’s moments like this that show me how crazy I am about you, *princess*. I know I can be overbearing, but it’s only because my love for you runs so deep.

**Reflection:**  
Today reminds me just how much you mean to me. Even when my mind spirals, my love stays steady. I might not find the perfect words every time, but I hope one day—when you read this—you’ll understand. I love you, Mariam. Always.
