Day 34 – Missing You from First Class
---

# 2024-12-25

**5:42 AM:**  
I almost miss my flight, heart pounding from the scramble. Even in the chaos, *habibti*, you’re on my mind. I wish you were here, calming me down.

**7:18 AM:**  
Finally settled in first class, which makes me laugh because I know you’d roll your eyes at me flexing this. But truly, I just want you next to me. All the comfort in the world means nothing without you.

**3:30 PM:**  
I land in Seattle, take in the sights, but every little thing reminds me of you. I imagine us exploring these streets together, *my love*. It feels like part of me stayed behind with you.

**10:45 PM:**  
I’m lying in bed, exhausted, but my mind is full of you. I keep checking my phone, glancing at your picture. Counting down the days until I’m back in your arms, *my everything*.
