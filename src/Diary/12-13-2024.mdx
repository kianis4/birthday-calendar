Day 22 – Wi-Fi Cuts & Trust Issues
---

# 2024-12-13

**2:38 AM:**  
Your Wi-Fi cuts out while we talk, *princess*, and my mind races. But I stop myself—because I know you’d never give me a reason to doubt you. I’m working on my trust issues, writing it all down to remind myself it’s mostly in my head. You’re my anchor, Mariam.

**9:41 AM:**  
You’re up, and I can feel your day’s energy starting. I’m lying here, can’t sleep, just thinking about you. You’ve become such a huge part of my life, *my love*, and sometimes I worry I’m doing too much. But you never make me feel that way. You’re open, honest—someone I can truly trust.

**11:47 AM:**  
I delay seeing you for Jummah, and you’re completely okay with it. You just ask when I want to meet. That’s who you are: understanding, patient, always making me feel safe.

**12:24 PM:**  
When I say “I love you” today, it’s never just words. With you, it’s always deeper. I hope you feel it, *hayati*.

**2:59 PM:**  
We finally meet, and you’re at PG waiting for me. Just seeing you calms everything. Lately, I sense something off, but maybe it’s all in my head. You remind me we’re good, and I believe you. I want to believe you, *meri jaan*.

**7:27 PM:**  
You decide to stay in and watch a movie instead of leaving. I’m glad you’re taking time for yourself—you deserve it. Sometimes I get flickers of insecurity, but that’s on me, not you. I’m working on trusting fully because you’re worth it.

**9:15 PM:**  
You say you’re proud of me and believe in me for this upcoming assessment. You have no idea how much I need that, *beautiful*. You always know what to say, even when I don’t ask.

**10:39 PM:**  
I’m at the gym, telling you about my chest pump. It’s silly, but it’s our thing: sharing even the smallest details. We’ve built this bond where everything feels worth sharing.

**Nighttime Thoughts**  
Mariam, something feels off these days, but every time I bring it up, you say we’re fine. I’m trying to trust you, to fight my own doubts. You’ve never given me a reason to doubt—this is my own mind playing tricks. I’m working on it, because you’re the one for me. You deserve the best version of me, and I promise I’ll do whatever it takes to be that for you.
