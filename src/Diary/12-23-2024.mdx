# 2024-12-23

**10:00 AM:**  
I wake up with a whirlwind of emotions, *princess*. You’re supposed to come see me at 3, and I’m excited yet a little uneasy. Something’s off, but I can’t place it. Still, I’m glad I get to see you before I leave for Washington in two days. I already miss you, *habibti*, and I haven’t even gone yet.

**12:00 PM:**  
I’m grinding hard, imagining the life I’m building for us. I see a day where I can spoil you—take you anywhere, buy you anything—even though you say you don’t need all that. That only makes me want to give you more. You deserve the world, *my love*, and I’m set on making sure you have it.

**2:30 PM:**  
My mind’s racing, picturing us together in just a few minutes. I’m thinking about running my hands all over you, kissing you in all the spots that make you melt. It’s crazy how you get me feeling this way, *hayati*. I want you—mind, body, soul—every inch.

**3:00 PM:**  
You don’t end up coming, and I feel a sting of disappointment. But I remind myself to focus on what needs to be done—the Amazon OA is calling. I can’t slack off because I’m doing this for us, too.

**7:00 PM:**  
I push through four solid hours of the OA, and honestly, it feels good. Still, you’re on my mind the entire time. No matter what I do, *gorgeous*, you’re there—my constant muse.

**11:00 PM:**  
I can’t shake the nagging feeling that something’s off, so I call. You reassure me everything’s fine, and I let myself believe it, even though I’m a bit unsure. I trust you, *my everything*, and I trust us.

**Reflection:**  
Today is all about effort—for you, for me, for the life we want. And babe, let’s keep it real—you owe me some serious head for all this love and care I’m pouring out. 😏 I’m kidding… sort of. But truly, Mariam, I love you. Always.
