Day 27 – Fighting Shadows for You

# 2024-12-18

**7:00 AM:**  
I wake up, and that familiar heaviness hits me again. Something’s off, Mariam, and I feel it in my bones. But I keep fighting because loving you matters more than any doubt. One day, you’ll see how far I’m willing to go to keep us solid, *my love*.

**12:00 PM:**  
I can’t focus. I try burying the feeling under work, but it’s there, *princess*. I know I’ll see you later, which soothes me a bit, but not completely. I’m thinking about how I’ll act, what I’ll say, determined not to show the fear inside.

**4:00 PM:**  
I’m waiting for you, mind racing over every recent moment we shared. No matter how heavy this feels, I’m still excited to see you. You’re the reason I push through everything, *habibti*.

**10:00 PM:**  
You text me once you’re home, saying all the right things, but I sense it—you’re holding back. I know you too well to miss these cues. But I bite my tongue and hold on to your words, wanting them to be true more than anything.

**11:30 PM:**  
At the gym, I try to sweat out the tension, repping each set for you, Mariam. I pray for strength, for clarity. Even when I feel like I’m slipping, I know you’re worth fighting for.  
No matter how off things are, I’m not leaving. You’re my world, *everything*, and I’ll keep reminding you of that.
