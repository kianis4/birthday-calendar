Day 28 – That Late-Night Breakdown
---

# 2024-12-19

**12:57 AM:**  
I can’t hold it in anymore. I text, “Are you okay, Mariam? I feel something’s off.” You don’t reply, so I call. We fall asleep on the phone, but it doesn’t calm me. I stare at the ceiling, mind racing. I’m not crazy—something isn’t right, *habibti*. I feel it like an ache I can’t soothe.

I love you so much, and it kills me to think you might not feel the same way. Maybe I’m overreacting, but if you saw my heart, you’d know why this is so hard.

**10:00 AM:**  
I wake up, and your messages are flirty, like the old times. I latch onto that hope, *princess*, praying it’s all in my head. I need to believe you’re still here with me.

**1:00 PM:**  
I work, but my mind circles back to you. I replay your earlier tone, that spark of normalcy. It soothes me but doesn’t erase last night’s dread.

**9:30 PM:**  
The day ends, and I’m exhausted. I miss how we used to be, the certainty, the easy comfort. I can’t shake thoughts of holding you, kissing you, being close to you. You drive me wild, Mariam—in every way. I’m torn between overwhelming love and fear it’s not enough.

I keep going, though. I’ll never stop loving you with everything I have, hoping one day you’ll feel it just as strongly.
