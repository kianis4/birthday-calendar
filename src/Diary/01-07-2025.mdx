Day 47 – The Final Entry
---

# 2025-01-07

**9:00 PM:**  
You just left, *hayati*, and it feels like the climax of a movie—where all the heartbreaks and sleepless nights finally make sense. I see in your eyes that we’re going to be okay, and my heart feels so full. I think about when I first called you “Habibti”—how natural it was, like I’d been waiting my whole life to say it.

As I reflect on everything we’ve been through, it’s like reading a script Allah wrote for us. When I started these entries, I was desperate to show you how much I love you. But through the tears and the chaos, I learned it’s about the actions: the prayers, the hustle, the never-ending effort to grow into the man you deserve. You didn’t just make me fall in love—you made me *better*.

**9:45 PM:**  
The wildest thing happens: I get an email that I passed the Amazon OA. I’m stunned—like all this time, Allah’s been guiding me toward this exact moment. How did I go from almost losing you to feeling like I won the lottery? It’s you, *princess*. You keep me grounded, even when we’re shaky. You’ve always been my motivation, the reason I keep going when everything seems impossible.

**10:15 PM:**  
This is the last entry, and I’m flooded with gratitude, hope, and pure love. *Mariam, writing these reflections has been my way of holding onto you.* It’s shown me that real love is about staying, about choosing each other despite the odds, about building something unbreakable. I’ve made mistakes, but I’ve never fought this hard for anyone in my life. I’ll never stop fighting—for you, for us, for the future we’ve dreamed up.

I feel at peace, *my love*, because everything is aligning. You and me, we’re not just surviving; we’re thriving. I vow to keep grinding, keep pushing, because you’re worth every ounce of effort. I love you, Mariam. You’re my *everything*.

Even though this is the last page, our story’s just beginning. One day, we’ll show our kids these diaries, laugh at the struggles and tears, and you’ll finally see the lengths I’d go for you. I started this saying, “Fuck around and find out, Mariam,” and you did—and I promise I’ll make you the happiest woman alive. Always.

**Forever yours,**  
Suleyman
