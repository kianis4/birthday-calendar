Day 43 – Dread & Hope
---

# 2025-01-03

**5:00 AM:**  
I can’t sleep, *princess*. I toss and turn, haunted by this dread about what you’ll say when I see you later. The fear of losing you is suffocating.

**5:45 AM:**  
I think about your birthday and how much it means to me. I’ve poured months into these reflections because I want you to feel as loved as you make me feel. I hope you see how deeply I care.

**6:30 AM:**  
I remember Valentine’s Day, the site, how you first said no, then came back with a yes. It confirmed everything—I want to give you the world, *my everything*.

**7:15 AM:**  
When you were in Egypt, I worked like a madman, wanting to be worthy of you. You inspire me daily, Mariam. Without you, I’d be lost.

**8:00 AM:**  
I think about my grad, the flowers you gave me—how it wasn’t just a gift, but a piece of your heart. I hold onto that memory like a lifeline right now.

**10:00 AM:**  
But now, it feels like you don’t even want to see me for your birthday. It crushes me because I’ve been planning every detail. I feel so stupid, but I can’t help how much I love you.

**11:00 AM:**  
You say you can come by after work, and I’m excited yet terrified. The fear of what you might say is gnawing at me, but I’d rather face it than guess.

**2:00 PM:**  
I’m counting down minutes, hoping you realize how much I’ve fought for us. You’re my entire world, Mariam. I need to see that in your eyes again.

**3:50 PM:**  
Almost time. My heart’s racing—part excitement, part fear. No matter what happens, know that I love you, *habibti*. Always.
