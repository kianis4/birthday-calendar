# 2024-12-10

**1:26 AM:**  
It’s late, and my head’s spinning from gym, work, everything. But I’m still thinking about you, *princess*. I send you the link to the site I’m working on, and I’m nervous because I want your opinion more than anyone else’s. You’re the measuring stick for everything I do, *my life*.

**2:35 AM:**  
I’m home, trying to focus on helping Sara with her essay, but my thoughts keep drifting to you, *habibti*. You’re the first and last thought in my mind. Even when I’m drowning in tasks, part of me always reaches for you.

**10:45 AM:**  
Your message earlier catches me off guard. You’re so sharp, so observant—one of the million things I love about you. But mornings feel empty without you. Even in silence, you’re in my head, and I’m counting the seconds until I hear your voice again.

**12:20 PM:**  
Just saying your name—“Mariam”—is grounding. You’ve got an exam coming up, and I tell you to eat because you push yourself too hard sometimes. You’re precious to me, *everything*, and I need you strong.

**12:58 PM:**  
You say, “Meet me at Mac,” and I feel my stomach flip. You sound distant, serious. I hate that feeling. I’m already plotting how to fix it, *my love*, because losing you isn’t an option.

**3:44 PM:**  
You finally start your test, and I’m caught between relief and dread. You say we need to talk, but there’s no time. The unknown weighs on me, yet my love for you never wavers, *habibti*.

**6:55 PM:**  
“Test is done, 84.” Hearing that number makes my day. You push through everything and come out on top—always. I’m so proud of you, not just for the score but for that fire inside you.

**8:19 PM:**  
“Proud of you.” I say it because it’s true. You’re a force, *hayati*, and I’m grateful you’re in my life. Your wins feel like my wins.

**9:48 PM:**  
I’m at the gym, but the weight on my chest isn’t just from lifting. I keep replaying your voice saying we need to talk. It scares me, *princess*. The idea of you slipping away is something I can’t handle.

**10:32 PM:**  
I’m still grinding, still thinking. I miss the ease, the lightness we share. Today felt like a storm, like everything’s hanging by a thread. But if there’s one thing I know, it’s that I don’t want to lose you, *meri jaan*. Ever.

We pull through—barely, but we do. And I realize how much you mean to me. You’re not just my love, Mariam; you’re my home. No matter how tough things get, I’m fighting for us. Always.
