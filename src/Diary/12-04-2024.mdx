"Day 13 – More Than the Weights I Lift
---

# 2024-12-04

**7:21 AM:**  
Good morning, **my love**. I wake up thinking about you, as usual. It’s cold, but picturing you cozy under a blanket warms me up. I can’t believe you shoveled snow this morning—it doesn’t sit right with me. I want to be the one handling that while you sip hot chocolate, teasing me from the window. You’re capable, sure, but I *need* to take care of you, **meri jaan**.

---

**9:42 AM:**  
I’m finishing up some client work, and you just switched to a new phone and my crazy ass is over here thinking about how you can run the location method now AHAHAHA. Anyway, It’s a small thing, but it feels big to me because every part of your day matters. I almost texted you right away, but I stop, enjoying this little anticipation—knowing you’ll fill me in soon enough. You’re the center of my world, **habibti**.

**12:13 PM:**  
Gym time. I’m pressing weights, heavier than you. I know you’d roll your eyes if I said that, but it’s true. I could easily pick you up, carry you anywhere you want to go. If we’re at home, I’d sweep you off your feet, and you’d pretend to resist, but I know you’d love it. You’re so light in my arms, **my everything**, and it makes me feel protective and proud.

---

**2:47 PM:**  
I finish a virtual meeting, but my mind drifts back to you, **gorgeous**. You’re a distraction I can’t escape, and honestly, I don’t want to. You’re the reason I push so hard, the reason I want to be better in every aspect of life.

---

**5:26 PM:**  
I grab a quick bite, thinking about how you always ask if I’ve eaten. You’re so caring, balanced with that playful sass that keeps me in line. I imagine you having steak and potatoes, probably sneaking bites of leftover pasta while giggling. You’re adorable, **hayati**.

---

**8:14 PM:**  
Driving home from the gym now, and all I can picture is you. Maybe you’re nestled in bed, maybe you’re still busy with assignments—I want to call, but I wait because I know you’ve got a lot going on.  
Today, I overhead pressed 145 lbs—heavier than you, my life. Makes me want to scoop you up and not let go.

---

**10:27 PM:**  
I’m in bed, can’t stop thinking about us. You’re my light in the dark. No matter what happens, you’re the one I see myself building a life with. I’ll never stop grinding, never stop dreaming. Everything I do is for you, **princess**.  
Goodnight, **habibti**. I’ll see you in my dreams.

—**Your man**
