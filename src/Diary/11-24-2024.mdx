# 2024-11-24

**9:00 AM:**  
I wake up feeling that familiar pull toward you, Mariam. It’s like you’re the first thought that anchors me every morning. You just send me a good morning message, and I can’t help but grin. Even when we’re apart, your words hit me like you’re right here 😏.  
I tell you I miss you because, let’s be real, I do—every damn day. I’ve never had someone get under my skin like you do, in the best way possible. You’re in my head, my chest, and, honestly, you’re creeping into my dreams too.

**12:30 PM:**  
We’re on the phone, diving into the Sara situation, and you impress me all over again. You break things down with this effortless clarity—it’s so attractive. You’re not just beautiful; you’ve got a sharp mind, and it’s sexy as hell.  
You say something that catches me off guard, and I pause for a second, letting it sink in. That’s the thing about you, Mariam—you don’t even realize how powerful your words are. Every time we talk, I’m reminded why I can’t get enough of you.  
Before we hang up, my mind drifts. I imagine you right here with me, your voice soft, your hands running through my hair like you do when you want me close. If I’m not so focused on grinding today, I swear I’m at your place right now, showing you exactly what you do to me.

**3:43 PM:**  
You just tell me you’re at home working on your essay while your mom and dad are out grocery shopping. I’m out here at PGCL, ready to grind like I always do. But even when I’m lifting, pushing myself to the limit, my thoughts drift to you. You’re the reason I go harder 💪.  
In the middle of a set, I picture you sitting on my lap afterward, teasing me for being so intense. I don’t argue. I pull you in, my hands sliding down your back, my lips brushing your neck, leaving you just as breathless as I am after these reps. That’s what you do to me, Mariam.

**5:15 PM:**  
I’m still at the gym, drenched in sweat, and I’m thinking about how you’d look if you’re here right now. You, in one of your soft little outfits, your skin glowing, your eyes locked on me. If you show up, I know I’m not finishing this workout.  
I press you against the wall, my hands gripping your waist, showing you exactly how much I want you. The gym can wait because nothing comes before you.

**7:32 PM:**  
You just tell me your parents are back, and you’re finishing dinner with them. I love how much you value your family—it’s one of the things that makes you so special. But in the back of my mind, I’m wishing you’re with me instead.  
I’m driving home now, the city lights streaking past, and all I can think about is pulling you close. I want to feel your hands on me, hear your voice telling me I’m yours. You’ve got me hooked, Mariam, in every way possible.  

**9:35 PM:**  
You just get into bed, winding down after your day, and I’m still out here grinding. You fill me in on your essay and how dinner went, and I admire you all over again. You juggle so much and make it look effortless. You’re a queen, Hayati, and I’ll never stop treating you like one 👑.  
Even now, my mind’s on you. I imagine how you’d feel if I’m there with you, your soft breaths as I whisper in your ear, my hands exploring every curve. I’m not letting you sleep yet, not until I show you how much you mean to me.

**At the end of the night:**  
Today reminds me why I hustle so hard. It’s not just for me—it’s for us. For the life I want to build with you. You make me want to be better, stronger, faster, and not just in the gym but in everything I do.  
You’re my drive, Mariam. My obsession. My everything. And I’ll never stop proving it to you.
