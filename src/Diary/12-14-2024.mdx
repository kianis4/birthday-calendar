# 2024-12-14

**9:23 AM:**  
Good morning, Mariam. You’re my first thought as soon as my eyes open, *princess*. I’ve got a test to handle, but you’re still right here in my head. I feel off today, but I know it’s tied to you—everything is.

**11:30 AM:**  
I’m working through questions but itching to finish so I can check in with you. Your “Good luck” earlier is all I need to keep me grounded, *habibti*.

**2:51 PM:**  
You tell me to take it easy when I mention my back pain. It hits me hard that you care so much. I wonder if I deserve that kind of care. I know I can be stubborn and hot-headed, but you make me want to be better, *hayati*—to breathe, to not sweat the small stuff.

**8:01 PM:**  
I’m out with the boys for Amraj’s dinner, but you’re on my mind constantly. I message you because I can’t help it. You’re such a balanced person, Mariam—someone who prioritizes the people who matter. It makes me admire you more every day.

**9:15 PM:**  
You tell me to let go, have fun, and not overthink tonight. You see right through me, *my love*. You know how to flip that switch in me, making it feel okay to just be.

**11:17 PM:**  
I crashed out at Hasan, hot-headed because hes being retarded. But you calm me in a single breath, suggesting I apologize. Only you can do that, Mariam—pull me back to a better version of myself.

**Nighttime Thoughts**  
I realize tonight that I could be around all my friends, having fun, but none of it feels complete without you. You’re my peace in the chaos, the one who makes me better. I’m not perfect, but you never judge. You guide me just by being you.  
I love you, Mariam—always in my mind, always my constant. And even when I feel off, you center me. You’re everything I need.
