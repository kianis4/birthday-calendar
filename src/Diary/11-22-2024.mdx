Day 1 – A Surprise in the Making

# 2024-11-22

Hayati,  
Today, the idea hit me like a flash of lightning—one of those moments where you’re like, “Sheeeeit” 😱. I told you I was going to do something for your birthday that you would never expect, something that no man has done before, and knowing you, you probably brushed it off like, “Sure, okay, mister mysterious.” But now that you’re reading this, I bet you’re smiling, huh? Guess you’re starting to piece together what I meant. All I can say is you fucked around and now it’s time to find out 😏.

The most special lady on this entire planet—scratch that, the whole universe—deserves something special for **your** special day. And, meri jaan, I’m not about to let you forget just how special you are.

The clock had barely struck midnight when this idea took shape. At 12:22 AM, I texted you a simple “I love you” ❤️. Just three little words. But what you didn’t know is that, as I hit send, my brain was spinning a hundred miles an hour, scheming up ways to make you smile months from now. Hehe, sneaky, right? 😏

You know, 2024 has been our year. The year I met you. And somehow, in what feels like no time at all, you’ve become my everything. The reason I wake up smiling. The reason I go to bed happy. The reason I don’t skip breakfast anymore (seriously, your voice in my head is all, “You better not be running on protein shakes again, mister” 🫠).

So today marks the first day of something I hope you’ll cherish forever. I’ve decided to write you a journal, capturing all my thoughts about you, every single day, until your birthday. Why? Because you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and this is my way of showing you that. Someday, maybe years from now, you can show this to our daughter. Tell her about how much her dad loved her mom. (Not that any boys are ever getting within ten feet of her, by the way. I’ll be at the door like, “Not today, Neggguhhh!” 😂)

But seriously, baby, let’s talk about yesterday—my graduation. It was a big moment, and while I was so excited to walk across that stage, I kept wishing you were there. I know you couldn’t make it, and yeah, I was disappointed in the morning. But one thing I’ve learned about us is that I can’t stay upset for long. You have this magic, this power over me. It’s kind of unfair, really.

As I was about to walk across the stage, the last thing I texted you was “I love you.” And you know what? I meant it more in that moment than I ever had before. When they called my name, I froze for a split second. My brain, my heart, my entire being? All of it was focused on you ❤️. Memories of us flashed before my eyes—the way we met, how quickly you stole my heart, the moments that have become my favorite memories.

And then, just like that, the anxiety disappeared. I realized something that will stick with me forever: You’re always with me. Even if you’re not physically there, you live in my heart, my mind, my soul. And knowing that gave me all the courage I needed to step forward.

So, I walked across that stage, my chest puffed out with pride—not just for my accomplishment, but for us. For everything we’ve built, and for the incredible person you are. My beautiful, intelligent, kind-hearted princess.

And that brings me back to today. This idea, this journal—this is my way of making sure you never doubt how much you mean to me. I always tell you that words fail me when I try to explain the depth of my love for you, but now, I’m letting the words spill out, no filter. For the next 46 days, I’ll document every thought, every smile, every ridiculous moment that you inspire in me.

Get ready, my love. You’re in for a wild ride. I love you, Mariam. More than anything. 😘

Forever yours,  
Suleyman
