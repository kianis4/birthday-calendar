Day 8 â€“ Craving Your Presence
---

# 2024-11-29

**8:21 AM:**  
You hit me with your good morning text while youâ€™re eating breakfast, and just like that, my day is off to a solid start. I swear, *Habibti*, you always know how to set the tone. Even through the screen, youâ€™ve got this way of making me feel like youâ€™re right here next to me.

You ask about work, and Iâ€™m already thinking about the grind ahead. But if I had it my way, Iâ€™d skip it all just to spend the day with you. I picture us sharing breakfastâ€”you sipping your tea, me swiping bites off your plate, and us laughing at some dumb joke I make. Then again, *my love*, once I get sweet, you might end up having me for dessert. ðŸ˜‰

**10:10 AM:**  
Iâ€™m heading out, running errands, but my thoughts keep circling back to *you*, *my beautiful everything*. I wonder what youâ€™re up to, how your morningâ€™s going, whether you thought about me while you were eating. I know youâ€™d roll your eyes if I said that out loud, but I also know youâ€™d smileâ€”because you love the fact I canâ€™t get enough of you.

**2:49 PM:**  
I just got back from Jummah, grabbed some Five Guys, and now Iâ€™m at Ryerson. The place is quietâ€”almost eerie. It feels like itâ€™s missing somethingâ€¦ or maybe someone. If you were here, *princess*, weâ€™d claim a corner for ourselvesâ€”your laptop open, me pretending to work but really just watching you. Youâ€™d catch me staring, call me out, and Iâ€™d lean over to whisper something thatâ€™d leave you blushing. You do that to me, *my life*â€”turn a silent space into something electric.

**4:49 PM:**  
Youâ€™re off to see Zeina, and Iâ€™m telling you to be safe. The truth is, *gorgeous*, Iâ€™m already missing you. I suggest we hit Ryerson together one day, knowing full well I wouldnâ€™t get much done if you were around. How could I focus with *my everything* sitting right there, stealing my attention?

**9:39 PM:**  
Youâ€™re home now, and Iâ€™m still at Ryerson, finishing up some work. Itâ€™s still quiet, still empty, but my mind isnâ€™t. Iâ€™m thinking about *you*, imagining how much better this day wouldâ€™ve been if you were across from me, filling this empty space with your presence.

I send you a picture, and you say it looks cozy. Maybe so, but without you, *Habibti*, itâ€™s missing the one thing that matters.

**At the end of the night:**  
Todayâ€™s one of those days where everythingâ€™s moving, but my mind drifts back to you. Even in the stillness of Ryerson, my thoughts are loudâ€”filled with images of *us*, with the way you make everything feel right. Youâ€™ve got this pull on me, *Hayati*, making me crave you no matter how busy I am. 

When I finally see you again, Iâ€™m showing you exactly what you mean to me. Until then, Iâ€™m grinding, thinking of you, and counting down.  

â€”**Suley**
