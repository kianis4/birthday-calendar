Day 25 – Subtle Doubts & Amazon Extension

# 2024-12-16

**9:28 AM:**  
Good morning, Mariam. My phone died last night, and I hate the idea of you texting me with no reply. You say, “That’s okay, babe,” and your reassurance eases me. But there’s still this little voice telling me I’m losing you. It’s quiet, *hayati*, but I feel it. Doesn’t mean I’ll stop trying.

**11:00 AM:**  
You ask what I’m up to, and I say I ate Five Guys and I’m off to campus to grind. Yet I’m still thinking of you. Every project, every skill I learn—I imagine it paving the way for a life where you never have to worry. You say I’m enough, but I want to be more, *princess*.

**3:14 PM:**  
I get an email—one week extension for my Amazon OA. You say, “That’s good, babe,” and I hear your voice in my head. It lifts some pressure, but I still want to excel for *us*. I want you proud of me, Mariam.

**4:27 PM:**  
You can’t answer because you’re getting your nails done. I love that you take time for yourself, but a part of me still wonders if you’re really okay. Am I overthinking? Maybe. Either way, it pushes me to work harder, *my love*. I’ll show you one day what all this means.

**6:00 PM:**  
You ask about my studying. I show you screenshots, wanting you to see how serious I am. You’re my partner in all of this, *habibti*. Hearing you’re cooking with your mom makes me smile because you give so much of yourself to everyone around you.

**8:42 PM:**  
You’re watching a show with your mom, while I’m doing situational prep for Amazon. It’s a small thing, but it’s us—both of us doing our own thing yet still connected. Even when I’m uncertain, these moments keep me grounded.

**9:32 PM:**  
I send you my prep, and you say it looks good. You always support me, even when doubt creeps in. I feel that wave of fear again—maybe I’m losing you, maybe I’m imagining it. But I won’t give up, Mariam. I’ll work harder every single day, for you, for us.

One day, you’ll see how much you mean to me, *everything*. I’m building not just for myself, but for the life I want with you. I promise I’ll keep showing up, no matter what.
