Day 17 – That Fire of Yours
---

# 2024-12-08

**7:40 AM:**  
Mornings with you, **my love**, are never dull. You’re texting about not hanging up again, your slightly annoyed but still sweet tone practically echoing through my phone. I can’t help but laugh. You blame the WiFi, but I know you’re plotting to pin it on me somehow. That little fire in you keeps me on my toes, **meri jaan**.  
I love the way you tease me, even when you’re “mad.” If you’re in my arms right now, I’m whispering “Come here, **beautiful**,” and all your frustrations vanish.

---

**8:14 AM:**  
You been scolding me about driving fast, telling me to slow down. I’m going 200 in life because *you’re* the finish line, **princess** hehe still got it ;). Every mile I run, every weight I lift, every grind session—it’s all for you, my **everything**. “Say okay, daddy, and I’ll slow down,” I tease, hoping to hear that laughter I love so much.

---

**9:07 AM:**  
I’m thinking how lucky I am. You’re worried about me driving, reminding me to be careful. You don’t just say you love me—you show it, over and over. It’s humbling that someone as incredible as you chooses me.

---

**11:19 AM:**  
You tell me you napped with Zeina, and I picture you curled up, breathing softly. I love how you find joy in the simplest things, like a good nap. It’s one more reason I adore you, **hayati**—you remind me to slow down and live in the moment.

---

**2:29 PM:**  
You got a haircut, and I’m over here imagining how stunning you look. Don’t cut it too short... I can’t wait to run my fingers through it, **my love**.

---

**3:22 PM:**  
You crack me up, talking about a “Dora” cut and joking about putting your “boobs in a box.” You’re wild, babe, and no one makes me laugh like you do. You’re magic. And either way, ain't a box I cant open ;).

---

**5:10 PM:**  
You ask me to stop teasing. “What if someone else is on the phone?”. Gorgeous, who else would I be calling but *you*? You’re my first call in the morning, my last at night, and every call in between.

---

**6:08 PM:**  
You beat me to texting first, and I’m grinning like an idiot. You’re competitive in the cutest way. You ask if something’s bothering me—letting me know you’re here if I need to talk. I love how safe you make me feel, **habibti**.

---

**7:20 PM:**  
Still wrestling with this laptop, and it’s driving me nuts. You check on me, and everything feels a bit lighter. You’re my balance, **princess**—the reason I push so hard and also the reason I remember to stop and breathe.

---

**9:55 PM:**  
You’re heading to bed, and I’m skipping the gym because of this laptop. I hate missing a workout, but you tell me to rest, and I know you’re right. You’re the one who keeps me from burning out, **hayati**.  
Goodnight, **my everything**. I hope you dream of us tonight. I love you more than words, **princess**.
