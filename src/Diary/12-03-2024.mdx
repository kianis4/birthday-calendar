Day 12 – Building Bigger Dreams
---

# 2024-12-03

**8:14 AM:**  
The morning starts off slow, but you’re the first thought in my head—like always. “Rise and shine, **princess**,” I whisper, stretching out, imagining how peaceful you look curled up in bed. It fills my heart to think about waking you up in the future—soft kisses, a whispered “**habibti**,” maybe a quick massage. That’s the life I’m chasing for us.

---

**9:47 AM:**  
The Emirates application is open on my laptop. I hover over the keyboard, remembering all we’ve talked about: raising our kids in the Middle East, giving them the upbringing you had, giving you the life you deserve.  
Dubai feels like this shining possibility. Even if I’m not sure it’ll work, the thought makes me smile. Because as long as you’re with me, **my love**, anywhere is home.  
I submit the application, breathe out, and almost text you. But I hold off—no need to jinx it. For now, I just imagine how you’ll react if this dream becomes real.

**11:36 AM:**  
You’re on my mind, as usual, while I set up my Skomp test. It’s gonna be long, but I don’t care. I promised myself I’d build something while you were in Egypt, so every test, every assignment, is another brick in our future.  
I’m exhausted, babe. I lean back, picturing you telling me to take a break and hearing your sweet laugh. But how can I slow down? You’re my **princess**—my reason for everything.

---

**2:23 PM:**  
I finally finish the test and grab a drink of water, letting my mind wander back to you. I think about yesterday, how I made you cry, and it tears me up. I never want to be the cause of your tears. I want to be the reason you smile, **hayati**.  
I hope when you read this, you see how regretful I am. I only want happiness for you.

---

**4:37 PM:**  
I feel like teasing you again, because you secretly love it. I imagine you pouting or using that fake mad voice, your lips pressing together, eyes narrowing—still so **gorgeous**. You’re the only one who brings out this carefree side in me, the only one who makes me feel like I can be myself without reservations.

---

**7:19 PM:**  
I’m thinking about dinner, scrolling through job listings in Dubai again. Even if Emirates doesn’t pan out, I won’t quit. You planted this dream in my head, and now I can’t let it go.  
I picture us in a bustling market, kids running ahead, you holding my hand, both of us laughing at their excitement. It’s simple, but it’s everything I want.

---

**9:46 PM:**  
I’m in bed, staring at the ceiling, still caught up in thoughts of us. You make me want to be better every single day, **my everything**—not just for me, but for the life we’re building.  
You’re my anchor, my muse, my reason to push forward. Tonight, I promise myself again: I’ll do whatever it takes to make you happy. You’re my life, **Hayati**.

—**Your man**
