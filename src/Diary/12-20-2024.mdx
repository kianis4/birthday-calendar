Day 29 – Searching for What’s Wrong
---

# 2024-12-20

**Morning:**  
The day starts out normal, but I carry this weight on my chest. I love you, Mariam, more than words, but I wish you’d just say if something is wrong. I’m in the dark, trying to fix what I don’t understand.

**12:30 PM:**  
I send you Haroon’s grades, feeling proud, wanting to share with you. You say, “Good job, proud of you babe,” and I pause because *I* already graduated. My mind spirals—is this me overthinking again? Probably. But it reminds me how badly I want you to see every detail of me like I see every detail of you.

**1:15 PM:**  
I’m on my way to Jummah, asking what dua I should make. You say you want:  
- A long, healthy life together.  
- Happiness for us.  
- Health for our parents and families.  
- Three ragdoll cats.  

Reading that sends chills through me. I save it as my wallpaper, thinking how it captures everything we’re building. I respond, “Inshallah, *meri jaan*. Unlimited cats for you.” When you say, “Love you, baby,” it grounds me. I pray with clarity, carrying your wishes in my heart.

**3:00 PM:**  
After Jummah, you ask if I’m going to work on the Amazon assessment. I want to hear your voice before diving back into the grind, *hayati*.

**Evening:**  
All day, your words echo in my mind. They remind me we’re good, that maybe all this doubt is in my head. You bring me back to what matters—us. I love you, Mariam. Writing these reflections helps me see we’re stronger than my insecurities. Thank you for grounding me today. ❤️
