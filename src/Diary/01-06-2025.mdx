Day 46 – The Jitters & The Gratitude
---

# 2025-01-06

**8:03 AM:**  
I’m jittery today, *princess*. I keep imagining your face when you finally read these 46 entries. Months of raw emotion, all for you. Will you cry? Will you laugh? Both?

**10:45 AM:**  
Locked in, focusing on the day’s tasks, but feeling so light. I’m counting blessings, and you top the list, *habibti*. You’re my first thought in the morning, my last prayer at night. *Alhamdulillah* for you, for us.

**3:27 PM:**  
Still can’t stop picturing your reaction. Every entry was written with you in mind, *my love*. I’ve realized love is sticking around even when it’s tough—and you’ve shown me that.

**8:11 PM:**  
It’s crazy how far we’ve come. These reflections keep me grounded, reminding me why I love you, why I choose you every day. And babe, I’ll keep choosing you, no matter what life throws at us.
