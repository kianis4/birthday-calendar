Day 35 – Seattle Dreams & Missing You
---

# 2024-12-26

**9:15 AM:**  
Seattle feels like a dream, but I’d rather be dreaming with you. I spend the morning with Ibrahim, talking about life. I tell him how you’re the one, *princess*, how I can’t wait for the day I marry you.

**1:45 PM:**  
Strolling around these nice neighborhoods, seeing the fancy houses, and I’m imagining a day when we have our own. You and me, building a life that spans every city we want to visit.

**8:30 PM:**  
Under the stars, I can’t stop picturing our future. You’re everywhere in my mind, *habibti*. Everything I see, every plan I make—it’s all for us.
