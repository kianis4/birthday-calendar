Day 14 – The Warmth I Never Knew
---

# 2024-12-05

**7:03 AM:**  
Good morning, **my gorgeous**. You’re already at work, and I’m here wishing I could’ve kissed you goodbye. The day feels lighter knowing you’re out there shining like you do.  
I scroll through my phone and find this post that hits me hard:  
> "You made me feel a type of love I never thought I deserved..."  
and I realize that’s exactly what you are to me, **hayati**—my safe space, my warmth, my drive to take on the world.

**11:42 AM:**  
I take a break, open my phone, and see your picture lighting up the screen. You, with that mischievous smile that makes my heart skip a beat. You tell me you’re in a town hall meeting, and I’m just picturing you being the most radiant person in the room. Everyone else fades away when you’re around.

**2:18 PM:**  
You say you’re at lunch, people chatting and drinking all around you, but you’re sneaking texts to me. It’s adorable. Even in a crowd, you’re still mine, **princess**.

**5:03 PM:**  
You’re on the train heading home, talking about a white elephant gift exchange. I love hearing every detail of your day—it’s like I get to live it with you. You say you’ve been grinding at the library, and I remind you it’s you who keeps me going. Everything I do is for our future, **my love**.

**11:32 PM:**  
Finally home, and you’re the last thing on my mind before I crash. I’m so grateful for you, **habibti**. You inspire me to be better every day. The love I have for you is beyond words—this all-encompassing warmth I never knew I could feel.  
Goodnight, **princess**.
