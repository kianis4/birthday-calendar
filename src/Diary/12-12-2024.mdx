# 2024-12-12

**10:42 PM:**  
The day starts like any other. I send you an email for something trivial, but I’m thinking about you anyway, *habibti*. By the time we speak, I sense today’s gonna test me.

**4:09 PM:**  
You tell me you’re late, heading out for tea before the gala. Something about you going to these events stirs something protective in me, *my love*. Because I know how people must see you—stunning, captivating—and it drives me crazy thinking anyone else might catch your eye.

**6:36 PM:**  
You reassure me your table is all girls, and I do a little fake-jealous routine. Deep down, I trust you. It’s others I don’t trust—because you’re a prize, *my princess*, and I know it.

**7:50 PM:**  
Then there’s the guy in the red suit, doing magic tricks. I picture him trying too hard, you being polite but unimpressed. If only he knew that no sleight of hand competes with what we have. I laugh imagining shutting him down if he tried too hard.

**8:01 PM:**  
You apologize for not replying, caught up in table games. I tease you, but honestly, as long as you’re enjoying yourself, I’m good. Your happiness is my priority, *hayati*.

**9:24 PM:**  
I get an email from Amazon—an assessment invite. First thing I do is tell you because you’re the person I want to share my wins with, always.

**10:05 PM:**  
You send me a video of the magician. I say, “Okay, you’re laughing a little too hard,” but I’m not actually mad. I’m just glad you’re having fun.

**10:18 PM:**  
You leave the gala, complaining about cigarette smoke in your hair. I wish I could’ve been the one driving you home, *my everything*, keeping you away from all that.

**11:35 PM:**  
I head to Kelsey’s for Amraj’s birthday, trying to ignore the lingering jealousy from earlier. Even in the middle of a crowd, my thoughts circle back to you. Are you in bed yet, thinking of me?

**Nighttime Conclusion**  
Today tests my patience in unexpected ways. Seeing you at the gala, even just through your texts, brings out that protective streak. But I don’t have to compete—I know what we have is real. You’re mine, Mariam, and that’s all there is to it.  
I love you. No red-suited magician or fancy event changes that. I keep showing up, even when my insecurities flare, because you’re worth everything.
