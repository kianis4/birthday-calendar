Day 45 – A Lighter Heart
---

# 2025-01-05

**8:12 AM:**  
I wake up feeling lighter, *alhamdulillah*. It’s like the weight on my chest started lifting. I thank Allah for another chance with you, *princess*. One day, when you read all these, you’ll see how much I cherish you. We might even show our daughter someday, so she knows what real love looks like.

**9:30 AM:**  
I sip my Fairlife, stare at our picture, and I’m reminded why I grind so hard—because I want to be the man who provides, protects, and treasures you, *my love*.

**11:45 AM:**  
Back to Amazon OA prep, but you’re my constant motivation. It’s like you’re fueling me, Mariam. I see our future so clearly: a big home, laughter, peace, everything you deserve. I’m working for that, every day.

**1:02 PM:**  
I can’t stop smiling at the way you check on me. You have no idea how much that means. It’s proof we’re a team, *habibti*. I promise to always return that care, forever.

**3:15 PM:**  
I take a break just to daydream about us—how we’re bouncing back stronger, how this love is rare. I’m all in, Mariam, and I’ll fight for us every single day.

**6:25 PM:**  
Back to the grind, and you’re in every thought. I want to ace this OA not just for me, but for the life I imagine with you. You inspire me to push further.

**9:14 PM:**  
Wrapping up, and again, I’m thinking of you. You’re the biggest blessing in my life, *hayati*. We’ve been through hell, but we’re still here, stronger. That alone keeps me going.

**10:30 PM:**  
As I settle in for the night, I feel at peace, knowing you’re the reason for this lightness. You anchor me, Mariam. One day, I’ll hand you these reflections so you see how much you mean to me. I’ll take care of you forever, *my everything*.
