Day 41 – Flying Home to Uncertainty

# 2025-01-01

**9:30 AM:**  
You text “Happy New Year,” and it sounds so dry. I know something’s wrong, Mariam. You say everything’s fine, but my gut screams otherwise. I’m not crazy—I just love you too much to ignore it.

**9:50 PM:**  
I’m on the plane heading home, waiting for you to text me goodbye, but nothing. At 10:00, you finally do, and I tell you I’m on the plane. Feels like you sense I need that.

**6:57 PM:**  
I can’t hold it anymore. I tell you about my Amazon rejection. It stings worse because I feel like you don’t even care. You say we should talk in person, that you’re not in the mood. I feel lost, *habibti*. I’ve been tripping, but I love you no less. I’m praying Allah brings us back to how we were, holding onto that hope, even though it hurts.
