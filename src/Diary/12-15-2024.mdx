Day 24 – SKOMP Exams & Niagara Trips

# 2024-12-15

**8:43 AM:**  
Good morning, Mariam. You ask if I slept well, and honestly, I sleep better just knowing I get to talk to you, *princess*. You say you’re heading to Niagara to shop, and my first thought is how I want to work harder so you never have to worry about anything. You say you don’t need much, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting to give you the world.

**9:39 AM:**  
I’m about to take the SKOMP exam, but it’s not just for me—it’s for us. Every goal I set is tied to you, *habibti*. When I picture the future, I see us building something incredible. That’s why I want to crush this test, so you never have to stress about anything.

**1:55 PM:**  
Three hours of grinding and I’m done. You’re on my mind the whole time—your voice, your laugh, the way you make me believe I can handle anything. I’m grabbing food, then back to it. This path isn’t easy, but *hayati*, you make it worth it.

**3:00 PM:**  
You say shopping is hectic, and I wish I’m there. Not because you need me, but because I want to see you light up when you find something you love. I want to be the one holding all your bags, just to see that smile.

**4:07 PM:**  
You miss my call and say sorry, but you never need to apologize, Mariam. I know how busy you are, and I love that you still make time for me. That’s who you are—always giving.

**6:15 PM:**  
You’re watching a movie, and I’m on Leetcode. Our nights look different, but I still feel close to you, *my everything*. It’s like your presence is with me, no matter where we are.

**9:24 PM:**  
You ask if I’m heading to the sauna, and it’s those little details—caring about my routine—that get me. You remind me the small moments matter, and it makes me want to push even harder for our future.

**9:51 PM:**  
You say you’ve been thinking about me all day, and I can feel it in my bones. It’s why I’m smiling for no reason, *princess*. You make me feel like the most important person in the world.

**11:10 PM:**  
I check out the sauna, but it doesn’t feel right, so I head home. I just want to unwind and think of you, Mariam. It’s wild that we’re halfway through December, and I’ve already written so much about you—24 reflections. But it doesn’t surprise me; you’re my heart, my anchor, my reason.  
You always say you don’t need much, just me, but I want to give you everything. I love you endlessly. ❤️
