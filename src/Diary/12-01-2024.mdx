Day 10 – You’re My Flame
---

# 2024-12-01

**9:45 AM:**  
I wake up feeling a bit sluggish, but I’m ready to tackle the day. I see your text saying you’ve eaten and might take a nap later. I grin, picturing you fighting off sleep just to get things done—because that’s who you are, **habibti**. Always on the move, always planning. I shake my head, though, because you deserve rest, **princess**, and if I’m by your side right now, I’m making sure you get it.

I take a second to think about you. Even in these small moments, you push me to be better. You’re like a flame that never burns out—keeping me warm in ways I never knew I needed.

**12:15 PM:**  
I’m at PGCL, head down, locked into the grind. Skompxcel tests are piling up, and I’m hammering away because I *need* this, **my love**. I hear your voice in my head telling me to take breaks, but I can’t stop. You’re the reason I’m here, the reason I’m busting my tail.  
When you were in Egypt, I promised I’d build something real for us. Now, every test I complete, every assignment I nail, is one step closer to that dream. You inspire me, **meri jaan**. I can’t back down because I want you to have the life you deserve.

**3:00 PM:**  
I step out for a chocolate milk from Fortinos, then head right back to PGCL. But my mind? Still on you. I check to see how you’re feeling, and when you say your cramps are bad, something twists in my chest.  
Then you tell me you took too much Maxidol, and I get a little stern—“Don’t do that, **hayati**.” I hate knowing you’re hurting. If I could, I’d take that pain myself. You’re **my everything**, and I need you okay.

---

**6:00 PM:**  
It’s snowing outside. I pause, staring at those snowflakes drifting down, and all I see is you. If you’re here, I’m dragging you outside just to hold you under the falling snow. I’d wrap my arms around you, whispering that you’re my world—my **everything**.  
Even when I pull myself back to work, my head keeps wandering to you. You’re my peace in all this chaos, my reason to keep going.

---

**9:30 PM:**  
I’m still going, pushing through more assignments. My body’s tired, but my heart is fueled by thoughts of you. You always tell me to slow down, to rest, but I can’t—not when I’m chasing our future.  
Every project, every late night… it’s all for **you**, **princess**.

---

**11:30 PM:**  
Finally calling it a night. The snow stops, and the silence settles in. But my mind still races with thoughts of you.  
You’re my **hayati**, my **love**, my **everything**. You push me in ways you don’t even realize. Everything I do, I do for us. I love you, **meri jaan**, more than words can say.

—**Your man**
