Day 4 – The Calm and the Fire

# 2024-11-25

**7:02 AM:**  
You just hit me with the “wake up, work” text, and yeah, I need it. I wake up in a weird headspace this morning, angry for no reason. Maybe it’s the lack of sleep or something on my mind I can’t pin down, but I’m not myself. I tell you I miss you, and I mean it. You’ve got this way of calming me down, Mariam, of pulling me out of my own head even when we’re not together ❤️.

**10:00 AM:**  
I’m at work, but my mind is definitely not here. I tell you I’m frustrated, but it’s more than that. I just need to see you. There’s this tension in me I can’t shake, this pull toward you that only gets stronger the longer we’re apart. You tell me to rest when I get home, to take a nap and reset, and I appreciate how you look out for me. But what I really need? You, right in front of me.

**1:54 PM:**  
I’m feeling better now. I tell you I’m good, but that’s because I let my thoughts drift to you. I’m picturing the way you look at me, the way you smile when you’re teasing me, that softness in your voice when you call me “babe.” It gets me every time.  
I tell you I need to see you because I do. I have this frustration in me that only you can fix. I want to hold you, kiss you, hear you laugh. You have no idea how much control you have over me, do you?

**3:44 PM:**  
You mention you’re going out for sushi with Zeina tonight, and I tell you to have fun. But let’s be real—while you’re out, I’m still thinking about you. I’m driving home, ready to lock in and grind, but my mind is stuck on you.

**5:15 PM:**  
You’re at dinner, and I’m in the gym, putting in work. Every rep, every lift, I push harder because I know you’re in the back of my mind, cheering me on. Between sets, I let my thoughts wander. I picture you here, leaning against the wall with that look in your eyes—the one that tells me you know exactly how badly I want you. If you’re here, I’m all over you. My hands trace every curve, my lips brush your ear as I whisper exactly what you do to me. You make me lose my breath, Mariam 😏.

**8:09 PM:**  
You just text me after dinner, and I tell you I love you. You didn’t hear me say it earlier, so I make sure you know now. Because, Mariam, I don’t want you forgetting it for a second.  
I’m still at the gym, wrapping up for the night. I grab a quick bite with Hasnawi, then jump right back into it. That’s me—a grinder, always pushing for more. But no matter how hard I work, you’re the constant at the center of it all, fueling me.

**10:00 PM:**  
You tell me you’re in bed, doing your skincare routine, and it makes me smile. You’re so soft, so feminine, the perfect balance to my rough edges. While you’re unwinding, I’m finishing my last set, sweaty and exhausted but feeling good because I’m working toward something bigger—for us.

**At the end of the night:**  
Today is a mix of frustration and focus, but you’re the thread holding it all together. Even on my rough days, you’re the reason I keep going. You’re my calm and my fire, my peace and my chaos all wrapped into one.  
You’ve got this hold on me, Mariam, one I never want to break free from. And when I finally get to see you, when I finally have my hands on you, you’ll know exactly how much you mean to me.

—**Yours Truly**
