Day 7 – Quiet Mornings and Late-Night Grinds

# 2024-11-28

**7:05 AM:**  
You’re up early, telling me you’re making breakfast. My first thought? I’d rather be waking up next to you. It’s not just the food—it’s the way you move around the kitchen in that oversized tee, hair a little messy. If I’m there, I’m pulling you in before you finish cooking, pressing a quick kiss to your neck, reminding you that breakfast can wait.

But here I am, going through my morning routine, already counting the hours until I see you.

**10:47 AM:**  
You mention wanting steak later, and my mind goes straight to dinner plans. I offer to make a reservation because I like things set for you, but you brush it off like it’s nothing—always so low-maintenance, but still every bit the queen. That’s your style. It makes me laugh at how effortless you make it all feel.

**3:00 PM:**  
I’m driving to drop Sara off, you’re out running errands. You tell me you’re too early for something and heading back home. Meanwhile, I’m stuck in traffic, thinking about how time crawls when you’re not around. You have a way of making life feel easier, even when you’re teasing me or throwing that playful edge my way. (Sheeeit, I might crash off a bridge just typing this.)

**5:25 PM:**  
You just say you’re in class, and I’m at Thode grinding. It’s one of those heavy days, but I’m pushing through because it’s leading somewhere—toward the future I want with you. In between tasks, I catch myself picturing the first moment I see you again: how I’ll hold you a little longer, let my hands linger on your waist, making sure you feel exactly how much I’ve missed you.

**9:06 PM:**  
You’re finishing up errands, and I’m heading to the gym. It’s late, but you know me—always one more set, always one more step. Even while I’m going through the motions, you’re still on my mind. Hard to shake you, Mariam.

**11:51 PM:**  
You’re finally home, hanging out with your parents, and I’m wrapping up my night. You promise to call when you’re free. I respect how you balance everything—family, school, me—without breaking a sweat. It’s one of the many reasons I fell for you. We do love a family woman.

**At the end of the night:**  
Another day of constant movement, but somehow, we stay connected through it all. That’s just us—no matter how crazy life gets, you’re still the center of my thoughts. You make me better without even trying. Whether it’s dinner plans, playful banter, or a simple text, it keeps me going.

And when I finally see you again, I’ll show you exactly what that means. No words needed—just my hands, my lips, and this whole, unspoken pull that you have over me.

—**Your man**
