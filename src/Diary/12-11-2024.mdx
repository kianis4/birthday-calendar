Day 20 – Late Nights & Library TVs

# 2024-12-11

**12:09 AM:**  
Another late night, *my life*. Applications, gym sessions—they all pile up. But none of it matters as much as you. I tell you I’m grabbing food at Chester’s, but honestly, it doesn’t taste the same without you.

**1:49 AM:**  
The Beaucourt boys bring a TV to the library. I’m there with Emil, but my mind is elsewhere—wondering if you’re sleeping okay, if you’re thinking about me, too. Even around a crowd, it’s your presence that grounds me, *habibti*.

**2:30 AM:**  
I’m home, but rest isn’t coming. Something feels off, and I can’t shake it. Yet I know one thing: I’m not letting go. Whatever this is, I’m here for you, *princess*.

**2:32 PM:**  
You say you’re done meeting, heading back to study. It’s a small detail, but it makes me think about how hard you work, *gorgeous*. You deserve the world, and I wish I could carry your stress for you, but you’re so strong—stronger than you know.

**4:40 PM:**  
You’re about to start your exam, and I wish I could be there, cheering you on. You always get anxious before these things, but I know you’ll crush it. Even if you don’t, I’m proud because you’re you.

**4:52 PM:**  
“Good luck, *hayati*.” I mean it with my whole heart. Even when I can’t be by your side, I’m rooting for you.

**6:48 PM:**  
You finish and think you do well. Relief floods me. But then you ask about my news, and I hesitate—so much on my mind. I’m not sure how to say it all, or if you’re ready to hear it.

**7:06 PM:**  
“If you don’t answer, I’m calling the cops,” you joke, and I find myself smiling when I shouldn’t. You have this way of pulling me out of my own head, *habibti*.

**9:41 PM:**  
“Don’t gym, babe,” you say. I hear that concern. Whatever’s happening, I’m not giving up on us, *my love*.

**Nighttime Conclusion**  
Something feels off, but I won’t let it break me. I see the subtle distance in your messages, the changes in your tone. I don’t know why, but I do know I love you. You’re my person, Mariam. Nothing will change that—no doubt, no distance. I’m here, and I’m staying, for us.
