Day 33 – Pre-Flight Chaos

# 2024-12-24

I wake up feeling the weight of tomorrow—I’m leaving for Seattle, and all I can think about is you, *habibti*. Every time I see our picture on my phone, I pause, wishing you could come with me. I’ve got errands on top of errands, but you’re glued to my thoughts.

**10:17 AM:**  
Rushing around, grabbing last-minute things, and every time my phone lights up, I hope it’s you. I want a day where you never have to worry about anything, *my princess*, where your biggest dilemma is picking a dress color.

**12:51 PM:**  
Still in the thick of errands, but let’s be real—I’d drop it all to be with you right now. The idea of being away from you tightens my chest, but I remind myself it’s just a few days.

**3:48 PM:**  
I’m heading to meet you at the barbershop, grinning the whole ride there. Even if it’s just a couple hours together, *my love*, those hours are gold to me. The world fades whenever I’m with you.

**6:00 PM – 9:27 PM:**  
Sitting with you feels like home in the middle of chaos. I catch myself memorizing your face, knowing I’ll miss you the second I walk away.

**10:09 PM:**  
Back home, it’s quiet now, and I’m scrolling through pictures of us. I already hate being away from you, *hayati*. It’s only a few days, but in my head, that’s too long. I picture us on the plane together, you holding my hand, making every moment better just by existing.

**11:43 PM:**  
I stare at our photo one last time before sleeping, feeling overwhelming gratitude that someone like you is mine. I love you more than I can ever express, Mariam. And yeah, I’ll miss you like crazy.

**Reflection:**  
Every glimpse of you today, every second spent together, reminds me why I do all of this. You’re my peace, *my everything*. Leaving tomorrow is tough, but I’m taking these memories with me, carrying them like reminders of what matters most—you.
